### Introduction
**SurvivalTop** is a spigot plugin that provides powerful wealth calculation features. If you are looking to get an accurate net worth of your players, then you have come to the right place! On top of being feature-rich, it supports integration with a wide range of other plugins, making itself available for many different users and boasting extremely flexible configurations. The plugin also does majority of its calculation tasks asynchronously, minimizing the performance impact that it can have on a server.

The spigot link to download the plugin can be found **[here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/survivaltop.96737/)**. If you require any assistance, please reach out for support on our **[discord](https://discord.gg/X8VSdZvBQY).** Alternatively, you may also open a github issue.

### Setup
Setting up the SurvivalTop project locally would involve the following steps:
1)  First, `cd` to the directory of where you wish to store the project and fork/clone this repository. An example is provided below:
```
$ cd /home/user/exampleuser/projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/TavernCraft-Devs/SurvivalTop.git

2) Knowledge of resolving Maven dependencies are assumed here. This is the most tedious part of the setup since there are some plugin integrations that require you to build those JAR files and include them in the `lib` folder of this project.

3) Once you are done with the setup, what's left is for you to make any updates/changes you wish to the code. Once ready, you may build the plugin with the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```
